# SN_Downloader
To use this script replace the first line "$numOfEpisodes = 563 .. 563" with the episodes that you want to download.

For example, the script as-is will only download Episode #563, to get Episodes 1 through 500 you would change the line to read this: $numOfEpisodes = 1 .. 500

Enjoy!
